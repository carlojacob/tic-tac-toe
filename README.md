### Development Process and Problem-Solving
This project started by developing an initial project scope, which was modified as necessary during development:
1. Developed wireframes for desired user interface.
1. Made considerations for how the game board would be displayed.
1. Placed heavy emphasis on meeting project requirements instead of making it "look good". Initially applied minimal SCSS to ensure that the user experience met requirements, and additional styling was added near completion as time permitted.
1. Placed heavy emphasis on performing new tasks in new branches and making regular commits. Branch names explain what changes were made on that branch, and often include just one commit.
1. I did not get to many of the stretch goals that I had looked up.

### Improvements/Unsolved Problems
The following improvements could be made:
1. Improvements to interface for user-friendly experience.
1. Modals for user inputs (authentication information).
1. Animations on button clicks and game completion, etc.
1. Add display of game instructions to user.
1. Provide additional pseudocode for understanding what is being done.
1. Refactor code in `/assets/scripts/game/ui.js` to a new `events...` document for improved readability.
1. Output additional game data on Game History request.
1. Game History in tabular format.
1. Create multiplayer functionality.
1. Resolve display issues on mobile in landscape orientation.
